# Obsidian_Theme
A colorful Neon purple theme powered by the primordial god of Darkness Erebus from Greek Legend. Inspired by another software that starts with the Letter O.

Update 0.2.0 
Okay so I put 400% more effort into the details for this theme then I originally did when I created it, so I hope you all enjoy ðŸ˜Š. 

This theme is based on the obsidian knowledge management tool, similar to remnote. Be sure to enable dark mode if you want to use it.
